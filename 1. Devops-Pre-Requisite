⏺ In CLI, various shells include
 Bourne shell (sh)
 C shell (csh or tcsh)
 Z shell (zsh)
 Bourne Again Shell (bash)

⏺ Old Bourne shell = limited
Modern bash shell = advances features such as arithmetic operations, conditionals and arrays.

⏺ To verify which shel you are using
> echo $SHELL

echo = prints text or value of an environment variable, as indicated by $(dollar) sign.

- Executing multiple commands in sequence by separating them with semicolons
> cd new_directory; mkdir www; pwd

⏺ Essential vi Operations :-
(some common operations in command mode)

Operations                   Command                       Description
Navigation                 Arrow keys or h, j, k, l        Move left, down, up and right respectively
Delete a character         x                               Delete the character under the cursor
Delete a line              dd                              Removes the entire line

To manage file operations: 
Save your changes: Type ':w' (you can optionally append a file name)
Quit without saving: Type ':q'
Save and quit: Type ':wq'

Search for text :
To find a word or phrase, switch to command mode and type
> /off
All occurences of "off" will be hihglighted, press 'N' to jump to next match and continue pressing 'N' to cycle through additional matches.


To check current username 
> whoami
To retrieve detailed information about your user account - including user ID, group ID, and group memberships
> id
to switch to another user account

Downloading Files from the Internet :-
To download files such as RPM packages, binaries, or images from the internet. You can use 
'curl' command, which downloads content from a specified URL. The '-O' option saves the output 
directly to a file:
> curl http://www.some-site.com/some-file.txt -O
or
you can use 'wget' command by providing the complete URL of the file.


Package Management
...............................

Package Managers = simplify software installation by automating tasks that would otherwise by manually intensive.

⏺ RPM - Based Package Management
CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Fedora use an RPM-based system.
RPM(Red Hat Package Manager) distributes software in bundles with .rpm extension.

Installing a package: Use '-i' option along with package name to install software from a 
                      specified location.
Uninstalling a package: Use '-e' option to remove a package
Querying package details: Use '-q' option to retrieve information about an installed package.

RPM does no automatically resolve dependencies. Ex, if you install Ansible - which requires Python and additional libraries - using
RPM alone will not install missing dependencies.

> rpm -i telnet.rpm
> rpm -e telnet
> rpm -q telnet

⏺ Dependency Management with Yum
Yum = high level package managers
It integrates with RPM while automating dependency resolution.
> yum install ansible
(yum searches its configured repositories, locates the specified package and its dependencies, and 
installs them in the correct order).

⏺ Understanding Repositories
Yum retrieves packages from software repositories - collections of RPM package stored locally or on remote servers.
'/etc/yum.repos.d' = repository configuration files located
If default repositories do not cover requirements or if latest version needed, then additional
repositories can be configured by following software's documentation.

To list available repositories, 
> yum repolist
To list configuration files that define these repositories
> ls /etc/yum.repos.d/
(Opening any of these files will show a URL pointing to repository location, where you can view RPM files available for download)

Listing installed or available pakcages
let for Ansible
> yum list ansible
Removing an installed package
> yum remove ansible

Listing all available package versions
use the '--showduplicates' option to list all available versions
> yum --showduplicates list ansible
